              contact with a provider through our platform. We are compensated by our partner

              <strong>Provider fees:</strong> The debt relief providers in our marketplace typically

              debt settlement providers may <strong>not</strong> charge or collect any fee until:

                They have successfully renegotiated, settled, reduced, or otherwise changed the

              <li>
                There is a written settlement agreement, debt management plan, or other agreement

              <li>
                The consumer has made at least one payment to the creditor pursuant to that

            <p className="text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400 leading-relaxed mt-3">
              When fees are charged, they typically range from{' '}
              <strong>15% to 25% of the total enrolled debt</strong>, though the exact fee structure
              varies by provider and state. Some providers may charge fees based on the amount of
              debt saved (i.e., the difference between the original balance and the settled amount)
              rather than the total enrolled debt. You should carefully review any fee agreement
              before enrolling with a provider.

            </h2>
            <p className="text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400 leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Credit impact:</strong> Debt settlement services may have a{' '}
              <strong>negative impact on your credit rating</strong>. Enrolling in a debt settlement
              program typically requires you to stop making payments to your creditors, which will
              likely result in late payments, charge-offs, and collections being reported on your
              credit report. These negative marks may remain on your credit report for up to seven
              years and may make it more difficult or expensive to obtain credit in the future.
            </p>
            <p className="text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400 leading-relaxed mt-3">
              <strong>Tax implications:</strong> Forgiven or cancelled debt exceeding $600 may be
              considered <strong>taxable income</strong> by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). If a
              creditor forgives $600 or more of your debt, you may receive a{' '}
              <strong>Form 1099-C (Cancellation of Debt)</strong> and may be required to report the
              forgiven amount as income on your federal tax return. This may increase your tax
              liability. You should consult a qualified tax advisor or CPA to understand the tax
              consequences of debt settlement in your specific situation.
            </p>
            <p className="text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400 leading-relaxed mt-3">
              <strong>Other potential consequences:</strong> Creditors may pursue collection
              activities, including phone calls, letters, and lawsuits, while you are enrolled in a
              debt settlement program. Debt settlement does not guarantee that all creditors will
              agree to negotiate or settle. Not all clients complete their program.

              Debt relief services are subject to state-specific licensing and regulatory

              &quot;Enterprise&quot; subscription receive priority placement and enhanced
              visibility. However, all providers in our marketplace must meet our baseline vetting
              criteria, including state licensing verification, BBB rating review, and industry
              memberships (AFCC, IAPDA).

            <p className="text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400 leading-relaxed">
              The providers in our marketplace are subject to the FTC&apos;s Telemarketing Sales
              Rule (16 CFR Part 310), which regulates debt relief services sold by telemarketing.
              Key consumer protections under the TSR include:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400 mt-3">
              <li>
                <strong>No advance fees:</strong> Providers may not charge any fee before
                successfully settling or reducing at least one of the consumer&apos;s debts.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Dedicated account option:</strong> If a provider requires consumers to set
                aside funds for settlement, the consumer must have the option to use a dedicated
                account at an insured financial institution that they own and control.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Truthful disclosures:</strong> Providers must make truthful and
                non-misleading statements about their services, including the likelihood of results,
                the time frame to achieve results, and the impact on credit.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>No misrepresentations:</strong> Providers may not falsely claim to be a
                government agency, nonprofit, or legal aid organization.
              </li>

              Settle In Peace requires all partner providers to attest to their compliance with the
              TSR and applicable state laws. However, Settle In Peace is not responsible for the
              conduct of individual providers and does not guarantee their compliance.
