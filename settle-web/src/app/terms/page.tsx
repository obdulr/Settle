            <p className="text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400 leading-relaxed">
              The debt relief providers in our marketplace are independent third parties. We do not control their services, fees, or practices. Any engagement with a provider is solely between you and that provider. We are not a party to any agreement between you and a provider.
            </p>
            <p className="text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400 leading-relaxed mt-3">
              We screen providers based on state licensing, BBB ratings, and industry memberships (AFCC, IAPDA). However, we do not guarantee the performance, results, or conduct of any provider. You should independently evaluate any provider before engaging their services.

            <p className="text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400 leading-relaxed">
              Debt settlement and debt consolidation programs may negatively impact your credit score. Forgiven debt exceeding $600 may be considered taxable income by the IRS. Results vary based on individual circumstances. Not all clients complete their programs. Not all services are available in all states. We make no guarantees regarding the outcome of any debt relief program.
